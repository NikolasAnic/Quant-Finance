    "In the theory of derivative pricing and no-arbitrage, we often need to **describe and use the information available at different points** in time. This is critical for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructing hedge portfolios.\n",
    "2. Modeling uncertainty.\n",
    "3. Defining the flow of information and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mathematically capture this idea, we rely on **σ-algebras**, which represent collections of subsets of a sample space that are \"resolved\" by the available information over time.\n",

    "## **Definition: σ-Algebra**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first define the intuition behind $\\sigma$-Algebra in the context of information (generation). \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intuitive Statement for a σ-Algebra**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **σ-algebra** is a mathematical structure that represents all the information we have about a random experiment up until a point t. Think of it as a \"lens\" through which we view the outcome of the experiment. Each set in the σ-algebra corresponds to a specific piece of information that can either be true or false based on the actual outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the most basic level (the **trivial σ-algebra**), we only know two things: \n",
    "  1. The entire experiment has occurred ($\\Omega$).\n",
    "  2. Nothing has occurred (the empty set $\\emptyset$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we gain more information, the σ-algebra \"expands,\" allowing us to resolve finer details about the outcome. For example:\n",
    "  - Knowing the result of a coin toss divides the outcomes into two groups: \"heads\" and \"tails.\"\n",
    "  - Knowing the first two coin tosses divides the outcomes into four groups based on the first and second tosses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In essence, a σ-algebra organizes the possible outcomes of an experiment into a structured framework of \"what we know\" and \"what remains uncertain.\" This makes it possible to assign probabilities consistently to events while respecting the information available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** \n",
    "Imagine you are solving a mystery with a sequence of clues. Initially, you have no clues, so your understanding is vague (the trivial σ-algebra). As you uncover each clue, your understanding sharpens, allowing you to eliminate some possibilities and focus on others. The σ-algebra represents the structured set of possibilities consistent with the clues you've gathered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our intuition, we can now formally define the $\\sigma$-Algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **σ-algebra** $\\mathcal{F}$ on a sample space $\\Omega$ is a collection of subsets of $\\Omega$ (called **events**) that satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "1. $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}$ (the full space is resolved).\n",
    "2. If $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $A^c \\in \\mathcal{F}$ (closure under complements).\n",
    "3. If $A_1, A_2, \\dots \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\in \\mathcal{F}$ (closure under countable unions).\n",
