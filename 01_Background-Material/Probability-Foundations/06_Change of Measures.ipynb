    "# Change of Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A **change of measure** involves using a positive random variable $Z$ to transform one probability measure $P'$ into another probability measure $P$. This is fundamental in financial modeling, where we change from the **real-world probability measure ($P'$)** to the **risk-neutral probability measure ($P$)** for pricing derivatives.\n",

    "## Theorem 1.6.1: Constructing a New Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P')$ be a probability space, and let $Z$ be a non-negative random variable satisfying:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $Z > 0$ almost surely,  \n",
    "2. $\\mathbb{E}_{P'}[Z] = 1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Define the new probability measure $P$ for any event $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A) = \\int_A Z(w) \\, dP'(w).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This transforms the measure $P'$ into $P$ using $Z$, which adjusts the weights assigned to events.\n",

    "### Definition: Radon-Nikodym Derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "The random variable $Z$ is called the **Radon-Nikodym derivative** of $P$ with respect to $P'$ and is denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = \\frac{dP}{dP'}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of $Z$:\n",
    "1. $Z > 0$ almost surely under $P'$,\n",
    "2. $\\mathbb{E}_{P'}[Z] = 1$,\n",
    "3. Expectations under $P$ are computed via:\n",

    "## What Does This Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Radon-Nikodym derivative $Z$ acts as a **lens** or a **reweighting factor** that modifies probabilities:\n",
    "- **$Z(w) > 1$**: The event $w$ becomes more likely under $P$ than under $P'$.\n",
    "- **$Z(w) < 1$**: The event $w$ becomes less likely under $P$ than under $P'$.\n",
    "- **$Z(w) = 1$**: The event $w$ has the same likelihood under both $P'$ and $P$.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Theorem 1.6.2: Radon-Nikodym Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "If $P'$ and $P$ are **equivalent probability measures** on $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F})$ (i.e., they agree on which sets have probability zero), then there exists a random variable $Z > 0$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\mathbb{E}_{P'}[Z] = 1$,  \n",
    "2. For any event $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(A) = \\int_A Z(w) \\, dP'(w).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The random variable $Z$ satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = \\frac{dP}{dP'}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Radon-Nikodym Theorem ensures that **any equivalent probability measure can be expressed using a Radon-Nikodym derivative**.\n",
    "- The derivative $Z$ determines how probabilities under $P'$ are scaled to create $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application in Financial Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "In financial models, we:\n",
    "1. Use $P'$ (real-world probabilities) to model observed market dynamics,\n",
    "2. Use $P$ (risk-neutral probabilities) to price derivatives, ensuring no arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "- The change of measure adjusts probabilities but does not alter the underlying sample space or random variables.\n",
    "- The relationship:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E}_P[X] = \\mathbb{E}_{P'}[X \\cdot Z],\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  allows us to compute expectations under $P$ using $P'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Risk-Neutral Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a random variable $X$ (e.g., the payoff of a derivative). Under $P'$ (real-world measure), the expectation reflects observed probabilities. To price $X$ under the risk-neutral measure $P$:\n",
    "1. Define the Radon-Nikodym derivative $Z$ such that:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}_{P'}[Z] = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad Z > 0 \\text{ almost surely}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute probabilities and expectations under $P$:\n",
    "   - Probability of an event $A$:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     P(A) = \\int_A Z(w) \\, dP'(w).\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Expected value of $X$:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\mathbb{E}_P[X] = \\mathbb{E}_{P'}[X \\cdot Z].\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Does This Work?\n",
    "- $Z$ reweights probabilities, reflecting the shift from $P'$ to $P$.\n",
    "- Prices derived under $P$ are arbitrage-free and consistent with the real-world dynamics described by $P'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Radon-Nikodym Theorem provides the mathematical foundation for changing probability measures. In financial contexts, it enables us to move from the real-world measure $P'$ to the risk-neutral measure $P$ while preserving the underlying probability structure. This ensures that derivative pricing remains consistent and arbitrage-free.\n"
