    "## Infinite Probability Spaces\n",
    "An **infinite probability space** models situations where a random experiment has infinitely many possible outcomes. Two typical cases are:\n",
    "1. **Selecting a number from the interval [0, 1]**, where the sample space is:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\Omega = [0, 1].\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A generic element $\\omega \\in [0, 1]$ could represent the daily return of the S&P 500 normalized to the unit interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tossing a coin infinitely many times**, where the sample space consists of all infinite sequences of heads (H) and tails (T):\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\Omega = \\{ \\omega = \\omega_1 \\omega_2 \\dots \\mid \\omega_i \\in \\{H, T\\} \\}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Challenge in Infinite Spaces\n",
    "In uncountably infinite spaces, such as $\\Omega = [0, 1]$, the probability of any specific outcome $\\omega$ is **zero**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\{\\omega\\}) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For S&P 500 returns, this implies that the probability of the return being exactly $0.01$ is $0$. Instead, probabilities are assigned to **events** (e.g., intervals or unions of intervals).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## $\\sigma$-Algebra in Infinite Spaces\n",
    "Let $\\Omega$ be a nonempty set, and let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a collection of subsets of $\\Omega$. We say that $\\mathcal{F}$ is a **$\\sigma$-algebra** if:\n",
    "1. The empty set is included:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{F}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "2. Complements of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$ are included:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A \\in \\mathcal{F} \\implies A^c = \\Omega \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{F}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "3. Countable unions of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$ are included:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A_1, A_2, \\dots \\in \\mathcal{F} \\implies \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\in \\mathcal{F}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For S&P 500:\n",
    "- $\\Omega = [0, 1]$ represents normalized daily returns.\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{F}$ includes subsets like intervals (e.g., $[0.01, 0.02]$), their complements (e.g., $[0, 0.01) \\cup (0.02, 1]$), and unions of intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Borel $\\sigma$-Algebra\n",
    "The **Borel $\\sigma$-algebra**, denoted $\\mathcal{B}[0, 1]$, is the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra containing all open intervals of $[0, 1]$. It is constructed as follows:\n",
    "1. Start with all closed intervals $[a, b]$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq 1$.\n",
    "2. Include complements of these intervals (e.g., $(a, \\infty)$ for $a \\in [0, 1]$).\n",
    "3. Add all countable unions and intersections of these sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets in $\\mathcal{B}[0, 1]$, called **Borel sets**, include:\n",
    "- Single intervals (e.g., $[0, 0.5]$),\n",
    "- Finite unions of intervals (e.g., $[0, 0.5] \\cup [0.75, 1]$),\n",
    "- Countable intersections of intervals, and\n",
    "- More complex sets constructed through combinations of these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For normalized S&P 500 returns in $[0, 1]$, events like \"returns between $1\\%$ and $2\\%$\" or \"returns not in the range $[3\\%, 5\\%]$\" are Borel sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Difference: General $\\sigma$-Algebra vs. Borel $\\sigma$-Algebra\n",
    "The main distinction lies in **how the $\\sigma$-algebra is constructed**:\n",
    "1. A general $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$ can be arbitrarily defined over a sample space $\\Omega$.\n",
    "   - For example, a $\\sigma$-algebra for S&P 500 returns might include only predefined intervals like $[0.01, 0.02]$ and their complements, but not all open intervals.\n",
    "   - Such a $\\sigma$-algebra is not necessarily related to the topological structure of $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Borel $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}([0, 1])$ is **derived from the topology of the space**:\n",
    "   - It starts with open intervals and includes all sets that can be constructed using complements, unions, and intersections of open intervals.\n",
    "   - It ensures compatibility with continuous random variables like S&P 500 returns modeled as a continuous distribution over $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of S&P 500 returns:\n",
    "- A general $\\sigma$-algebra might only allow certain events like \"returns between $1\\%$ and $2\\%$\" or \"returns below $1\\%$.\"\n",
    "- The Borel $\\sigma$-algebra allows for a richer set of events, including complex combinations of intervals, which is crucial for defining probabilities of continuous distributions (e.g., normal or log-normal distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability Measure\n",
    "A **probability measure** $P$ assigns probabilities to events $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$. It satisfies:\n",
    "1. The probability of the entire sample space is $1$:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(\\Omega) = 1.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "2. Countable additivity: If $A_1, A_2, \\dots$ are disjoint sets in $\\mathcal{F}$:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(A_n).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider S&P 500 returns where:\n",
    "- $\\Omega = [0, 1]$,\n",
    "- $P([0.01, 0.02]) = 0.01$,\n",
    "- $P([0.02, 0.03]) = 0.01$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for disjoint intervals:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P([0.01, 0.02] \\cup [0.02, 0.03]) = P([0.01, 0.02]) + P([0.02, 0.03]) = 0.02.\n",

    "## Probability Space\n",
    "\n",
    "A **probability space** is defined as the triplet:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\Omega$: The sample space, representing all possible outcomes of the random experiment.\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{F}$: The $\\sigma$-algebra, representing all events (subsets of $\\Omega$) for which probabilities are defined.\n",
    "- $P$: The probability measure, assigning probabilities to events A $\\in$ $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability measure $P$ must satisfy the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property 1: $P(\\emptyset) = 0$\n",
    "The probability of the empty set must be zero, as it represents an event with no possible outcomes:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\emptyset) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This ensures consistency with the interpretation of probability, as there is no chance for an impossible event to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property 2: $P(\\Omega) = 1$\n",
    "The probability of the entire sample space must equal one:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\Omega) = 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This reflects the fact that one of the outcomes in $\\Omega$ must occur with certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property 3: Countable Additivity\n",
    "For any sequence of disjoint events $A_1, A_2, \\dots \\in \\mathcal{F}$, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(A_n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This property ensures that probabilities are additive for mutually exclusive events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property 4: Finite Additivity\n",
    "For finitely many disjoint events $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N \\in \\mathcal{F}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^N A_n\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^N P(A_n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Finite additivity follows as a special case of countable additivity and ensures that probabilities are consistent when dealing with finite collections of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property 5: Complement Rule\n",
    "The probability of the complement of an event $A$ is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A^c) = 1 - P(A),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $A^c = \\Omega \\setminus A$. This follows from the fact that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A \\cup A^c) = P(\\Omega) = 1,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and $A \\cap A^c = \\emptyset$, so:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A \\cup A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Properties Must Hold\n",
    "These properties ensure that the probability measure $P$ is consistent with our intuition about probability:\n",
    "1. The empty event cannot occur, so its probability is zero.\n",
    "2. The entire sample space must account for all possibilities, so its probability is one.\n",
    "3. Additivity (both countable and finite) ensures that the probability of a union of disjoint events is the sum of their probabilities.\n",
    "4. The complement rule ensures consistency in how probabilities are assigned to events and their complements, reflecting that $A$ and $A^c$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of S&P 500 returns:\n",
    "- $P(\\emptyset) = 0$ reflects that an impossible return (e.g., outside defined bounds) has zero probability.\n",
    "- $P(\\Omega) = 1$ reflects that the return must fall somewhere within the defined range of possible outcomes.\n",
    "- Additivity ensures that probabilities for disjoint intervals of returns (e.g., [0, 0.01] and [0.01, 0.02]) sum to the probability of the union [0, 0.02].\n",
    "- The complement rule allows us to compute probabilities for returns outside specific intervals (e.g., $P([\\text{not in } [0.01, 0.02]]) = 1 - P([0.01, 0.02])$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lebesgue Measure\n",
    "The **Lebesgue measure** is a uniform probability measure defined on the interval $[0, 1]$. It assigns probabilities proportional to the length of intervals. Formally, for a closed interval $[a, b] \\subseteq [0, 1]$, the probability is defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P([a, b]) = b - a, \\quad 0 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties include:\n",
    "1. The probability of a single point is zero:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(\\{a\\}) = 0.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   This reflects that in an uncountable space, individual outcomes are infinitesimally unlikely.\n",
    "2. The probability of the entire space is one:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P([0, 1]) = 1.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "3. For disjoint intervals, probabilities add:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P([a, b] \\cup [c, d]) = P([a, b]) + P([c, d]), \\quad \\text{if } [a, b] \\cap [c, d] = \\emptyset.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the context of S&P 500 returns normalized to $[0, 1]$, the probability of returns between $1\\%$ and $2\\%$ is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P([0.01, 0.02]) = 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.01.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The Lebesgue measure is also extended to more complex subsets of $[0, 1]$ using the properties of probability measures.\n",

    "## Infinite Coin Toss Space and the Paradox of Uncountable Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infinite Coin Toss Space\n",
    "Consider the random experiment of tossing a coin infinitely many times. The sample space is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Omega = \\{\\omega = \\omega_1 \\omega_2 \\omega_3 \\dots \\mid \\omega_i \\in \\{H, T\\}\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Each outcome $\\omega$ is an infinite sequence of heads (H) and tails (T), e.g., $\\omega = HHTHT\\ldots$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructing the Probability Measure\n",
