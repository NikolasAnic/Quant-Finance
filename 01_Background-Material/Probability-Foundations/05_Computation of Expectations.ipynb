    "## Definition: Borel-Measurable Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is called **Borel-measurable** if for every Borel set $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$, the preimage $g^{-1}(B)$ is a Borel set in $\\mathbb{R}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, for any $B \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$, where $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ is the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g^{-1}(B) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : g(x) \\in B\\} \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Borel-measurable function maps Borel sets in the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ back to Borel sets in the domain $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "- Borel-measurability ensures that the function is compatible with the structure of the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra, allowing integration and other operations to be well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Functions**: Every continuous function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is Borel-measurable because the preimage of an open set (which is a Borel set) under a continuous function is also an open set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step Functions**: Functions that take only finitely many values and are constant on intervals are Borel-measurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indicator Functions**: The function $\\mathbb{I}_A(x)$, which is $1$ if $x \\in A$ and $0$ otherwise, is Borel-measurable if $A \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Borel-measurability is essential in probability and measure theory because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It ensures that the integral of a function can be well-defined with respect to a measure.\n",
    "2. It allows functions to be compatible with random variables and their distributions, facilitating computations in expectation and probability.\n",

    "## Definition of Expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a random variable on a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$. The **expectation** of $X$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\int_\\Omega X(\\omega) \\, dP(\\omega),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which averages the values of $X(\\omega)$ over $\\Omega$, taking probabilities into account. Note that this is the same definition as in the chapter before where we defined Lebesgue integral as a infinitisemaly small range between values on the y axis defined as probabilities of individual outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: Expectation satisfies:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[X + Y] = \\mathbb{E}[X] + \\mathbb{E}[Y].\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computation**: For practical computations, we rely on the distribution of $X$ rather than integrating over the abstract space $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution Measure of a Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The **distribution measure** $\\mu_X$ of a random variable $X$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_X(B) = P(X \\in B), \\quad \\text{for every Borel subset } B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to express expectations in terms of integrals over $\\mathbb{R}$ instead of $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theorem 1.5.1: Relating Abstract and Real Integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a random variable on $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$, and let $g$ be a Borel-measurable function on $\\mathbb{R}$. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For non-negative $g$:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[|g(X)|] = \\int_\\mathbb{R} |g(x)| \\, d\\mu_X(x).\n",

    "### Explanation for Theorem 1.5.1: Relating Abstract and Real Integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 1.5.1** establishes a relationship between the abstract Lebesgue integral over a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$ and the Lebesgue integral over the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, using the distribution measure $\\mu_X$ of a random variable $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea:\n",
    "- Instead of integrating over the abstract sample space $\\Omega$, we can integrate over the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ with respect to $\\mu_X$.\n",
    "- The distribution measure $\\mu_X$ captures the probabilities of $X$ taking values in subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Useful?\n",
    "The probability space $\\Omega$ is often abstract and complex, making direct computation challenging. By mapping the problem to $\\mathbb{R}$, we can use familiar tools, such as densities or sums, to compute expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Impact:\n",

    "   \\mathbb{E}[|g(X)|] = \\int_\\mathbb{R} |g(x)| \\, d\\mu_X(x).\n",

    "### 1. Discrete Random Variables\n",
    "If $X$ takes only finitely many values $\\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$, then $\\mu_X$ places a mass $P_k = P(X = x_k)$ at each $x_k$. The expectation becomes:\n",

    "- This allows us to compute expectations directly using the density.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Is This Useful?\n",
    "When $X$ has a density, $\\mu_X$ integrates naturally with $f(x)$, simplifying computations. Instead of working with abstract measures, we compute expectations directly in terms of $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results:\n",
    "1. For a non-negative Borel-measurable function $g$:\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "#### Example:\n",
    "Suppose $X$ has a density $f(x) = e^{-x} \\mathbb{I}_{\\{x \\geq 0\\}}$ (Exponential distribution with rate 1). To compute $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]$:\n",
    "1. Use the formula:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x^2 f(x) \\, dx.\n",

    "   \\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\int_0^\\infty x^2 e^{-x} \\, dx.\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "2. **Use integration by parts**:\n",
    "   Let:\n",
    "   - $u = x^2$ (so that $du = 2x \\, dx$),\n",
    "   - $dv = e^{-x} \\, dx$ (so that $v = -e^{-x}$).\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate the boundary term**:\n",
    "   At $x = \\infty$, $-x^2 e^{-x} \\to 0$ because $e^{-x}$ decays faster than $x^2$ grows.  \n",
    "   At $x = 0$, $-x^2 e^{-x} = 0$.  \n",
